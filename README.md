### Hi there <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="20">

My name is **Sayed Mohammed Nouman** and I go by the alias of **Skyhero**. I am in my second year pursuing my bachelor's of engineering in Information Technology. I am very interested in contributing to open source projects and collaborating with different people and learning new and more about different technologies.
